excerpt: 'Text to speech (TTS) systems hold promise as an information access tool for literate and illiterate including visually impaired. Current TTS systems can convert a typical text into a  natural sounding speech. However, auditory rendering of mathematical content, specifically equation reading is not a trivial task. Mathematical equations have to be read so that appropriate bracketing such as parentheses, superscripts and subscripts are conveyed to the listener in an accurate way. 
In this paper, we first analyse the acoustic cues which humans employ while speaking the mathematical content to (visually impaired) listeners and then propose four techniques which render the observed patterns in a text-to-speech system. '
