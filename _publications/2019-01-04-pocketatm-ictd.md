excerpt: 'Visually impaired people (VIPs) face significant usability and privacy challenges using digital finance technologies. In this paper, we
focus on investigating these challenges in the context of Automated
Teller Machines (ATMs) in India. To find out the accessibility status
of ATMs across India, we first reach out to public banks, and then
conduct in-person field surveys and an online crowd sourcing survey of 107 ATM machines across 4 cities in India. We find that less
than 18% of surveyed machines are accessible, and follow up with
22 interviews with VIPs regarding challenges using ATMs. Based
on insights, we design PocketATM: a system that enables VIPs to
use ATMs using their own smartphones - a user can pre-authorize
a cash withdrawal using a phone application, then go to any nearby
ATM to receive the pre-authorized amount. Our usability evaluation with 19 VIPs demonstrates that PocketATM is usable, practical,
and could be embraced by VIPs in India.'
