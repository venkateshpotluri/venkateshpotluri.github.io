I am a Ph.D. Student in computer science and engineering at the [Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu), University of Washington. I am advised by [Prof Jennifer Mankoff](https://make4all.org/portfolio/jennifer-mankoff/).

Prior to starting at UW, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) and am advised by [Dr. Manohar Swaminathan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/). Broadly, my research interests are in the areas of HCI and Accessibility. My current focus is on improving developer productivity for visually impaired developers in GUI based programming environments. I am a B.Tech HONS and MS by Research (dual degree) graduate from [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) and was advised by [Dr. Kishore S Prahallad](https://sites.google.com/site/kishoreprahallad/) and [Dr. Priyanka Srivastava](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~priyanka.srivastava/) on my thesis on [Audio Rendering of Mathematical Content](files/ms_thesis.pdf). There is lots to know about me here. When we meet (in person or over a skype call), lets brainstorm on the next big opportunity to improve accessibility and make the world a more inclusive place.

## Why accessibility?
Due to my vision impairment, I adapted various methods for learning and independent daily living. In this process, I have used different variety of assistive technology.

I realised that a lot of these were lacking in functionality and there was a wide scope and need for improvement. I want to contribute in developing assistive technology by looking at a problem from both the user as well as a researcher and developer perspective. With improved accessibility as a mission, I have directed my efforts in improving access to STEM (math and computer programming) so far through [Audio Rendering of Mathematical Content](/projects/math) and, [CodeTalk](/projects/codetalk) and [SoundScape for Visual Studio](projects/soundscape) projects respectively.

In addition to improving access to technical content and tools, I believe it is equally important to spread awareness on how technology can empower people with visual impairments to achieve their dreams. My efforts in this direction span across designing and organizing [training workshops on assistive technology](workshops/), [invited talks](talks/) and helping other visually impaired students in India through Inclusive STEM, a group to promote STEM education and careers.

## Important Updates

* **[CodeTalk](/projects/codetalk) is now open source! [Click here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/codetalk-rethinking-ide-accessibility/) for more information.** <br/>
